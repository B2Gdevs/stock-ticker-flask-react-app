# Flask Stock Ticker Purchasing APP

## PostMan API Collection Documentation
* https://documenter.getpostman.com/view/6832471/2s8YmEykpv

## Usage
_I recommend to use a virtual env._
> This was built oon Python 3.10.5

* `pip install -r requirements.txt`
* __FIRST:__ `Start Backend`:
  * Just run `bash start_backend.sh` after replacing your `POSTGRES` settings (keeping mine in their for this challenge)
* __SECOND:__ `Start Frontend`
  * Just run `bash start_frontend.sh`

## Initialize App Data
_for the challenge don't do this, it is already done, and I left the DB in tact with creds here._

If using your own DB, after running `flask shell`, import the db from the app and create the tables
```
>>> from app import db, app
>>> db.create_all()
>>>   
```

## Bugs/Enhancements
- [x] Dropdown not updating to newly selected value
- [ ] Remove hard coding of user id when creating orders (API supports multiple users and orders)
- [ ] Yeesh, make it look nice.  Wasted time with Bootstrap CSS not loading.
